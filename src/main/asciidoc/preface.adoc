Preface

The Spring Data Aerospike project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions using the Aerospike key-value style data store.  We provide a "template" as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying data. You will notice similarities to the JDBC support in the Spring Framework.

This document is the reference guide for Spring Data - Aerospike Support. It explains Aerospike module concepts and semantics and the syntax for various stores namespaces.

This section provides some basic introduction to Spring and the Aerospike database. The rest of the document refers only to Spring Data Aerospike features and assumes the user is familiar with Aerospike as well as Spring concepts.

[[get-started:first-steps:spring]]
== Knowing Spring
Spring Data uses Spring framework's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/spring-core.html[core] functionality, such as the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html[IoC] container, http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html#core-convert[type conversion system], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[expression language], http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jmx.html[JMX integration], and portable http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/dao.html#dao-exceptions[DAO exception hierarchy]. While it is not important to know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar for whatever IoC container you choose to use.

The core functionality of the Aerospike and CouchDB support can be used directly, with no need to invoke the IoC services of the Spring Container. This is much like `JdbcTemplate` which can be used 'standalone' without any other services of the Spring container. To leverage all the features of Spring Data document, such as the repository support, you will need to configure some parts of the library using Spring.

To learn more about Spring, you can refer to the comprehensive (and sometimes disarming) documentation that explains in detail the Spring Framework. There are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on the matter - take a look at the Spring framework http://spring.io/docs[home page ] for more information.

[[get-started:first-steps:nosql]]
== Knowing NoSQL and Aerospike
NoSQL stores have taken the storage world by storm. It is a vast domain with a plethora of solutions, terms and patterns (to make things worth even the term itself has multiple http://www.google.com/search?q=nosoql+acronym[meanings]). While some of the principles are common, it is crucial that the user is familiar to some degree with Aerospike key-value store operations that supply the mechanism for associating keys with a set of named values, similar to a row in standard RDBMS terminology.  The data layer in Aerospike Database is optimized to store data in solid state drives, RAM, or traditional rotational media. The database indices are stored in RAM for quick availability, and data writes are optimized through large block writes to reduce latency. The software also employs two sub-programs that are codenamed Defragmenter and Evictor. Defragmenter removes data blocks that have been deleted, and Evictor frees RAM space by removing references to expired records.

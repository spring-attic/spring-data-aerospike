[[aerospike.aerospike-3]]
= Aerospike Support

Aerospike support contains a wide range of features which are summarized below.

* Spring configuration support using Java based @Configuration classes or an XML namespace for a Aerospike driver instance and replica sets
* AerospikeTemplate helper class that increases productivity performing common Aerospike operations.
* Exception translation into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy
* Feature Rich Object Mapping integrated with Spring's Conversion Service
* Annotation based mapping metadata but extensible to support other metadata formats
* Java based Query, Criteria, and Update DSLs
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces including support for custom finder methods.

[[aerospike-getting-started]]
== Getting Started

Spring Data Aerospike uses Java Client, Aerospikeâ€™s Java client enables you to build applications in Java that store and retrieve data from an Aerospike cluster. It contains both synchronous and asynchronous calls to the database.

The Java Client runs on any platform with Java 1.6 version and above.

First you need to set up a running Aerospike server.

To create a Spring project in STS go to File -> New -> Spring Template Project -> Simple Spring Utility Project -> press Yes when prompted. Then enter a project and a package name such as org.spring.aerospike.example.

Then add the following to pom.xml dependencies section.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>

  <!-- other dependency elements omitted -->

  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.aerospike</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-aerospike</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.1.RELEASE</version>
  </dependency>

</dependencies>
----

You can either setup Spring Boot or Spring application. Basic setup of Spring Boot application is described under the following link: https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot.

In case you do no want to use Spring Boot, the best way to manage Spring dependencies is declaring `spring-framework-bom` of needed version in `dependencyManagement` section of your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${place needed spring version here}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Create a simple Person class to persist.

[source,java]
----
package org.springframework.data.aerospike.example;

public class Person {
	
	 public final String id;
	 public final String name;
	 public final int age;

	 public Person(String id, String name, int age) {
	  this.id = id;
	  this.name = name;
	  this.age = age;
	 }

	 @Override
	 public String toString() {
	  return "Person [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
	 }

}
----

In the simplest case, your repository will extend the CrudRepository<T, String>, where T is the entity that you want to expose.

[source,java]
----
package org.springframework.data.aerospike.example.repo;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, String> {
}
----
Please note that this is just an interface and not an actual class. In the background, when your context gets initialized, actual implementations for your repository descriptions get created and you can access them through regular beans.
This means you will save lots of boilerplate code while still exposing full CRUD semantics to your service layer and application.

To setup configuration for Aerospike you will need to subclass `AbstractAerospikeDataConfiguration`:

[source,java]
----
package org.springframework.data.aerospike.example.config;

import com.aerospike.client.Host;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.aerospike.repository.config.EnableAerospikeRepositories;
import org.springframework.data.aerospike.example.repo.PersonRepository;

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Collections;

@Configuration
@EnableAerospikeRepositories(basePackageClasses = PersonRepository.class)
public class AerospikeConfiguration extends AbstractAerospikeDataConfiguration  {

	@Override
	protected Collection<Host> getHosts() {
		return Collections.singleton(new Host("localhost", 3000));
	}

	@Override
	protected String nameSpace() {
		return "SAMPLE";
	}
}
----

Now you are ready to inject and use `PersonRepository` in your application.

[[aerospike.auditing]]
== General auditing configuration

Auditing support is not available in the current version.

[[aerospike-template]]
== Introduction to AerospikeTemplate

The template provides lower level access to the underlying database and also serves as the foundation for repositories.
Any time a repository is too high-level for you needs chances are good that the templates will serve you well.

[[aerospike-template.instantiating]]
=== Instantiating AerospikeTemplate

If you are subclassing `AbstractAerospikeDataConfiguration` then bean `aerospikeTemplate` is already present in your context and you can use it.
Otherwise you can instantiate it yourself, please, check how it can be done in `AbstractAerospikeDataConfiguration`.

`AerospikeTemplate` provides basic operations with indexes: `createIndex`, `deleteIndex`, `indexExists`. For inserting documents `insert` can be used, for updating `update`.

In case you need to use custom `WritePolicy` `persist` operation can be used. For CAS updates `save` operation must be used.

To delete documents use `delete` methods, for loading documents you can use `findById` or `findByIds` operations. For indexed documents use `find` with provided `Query` object.
